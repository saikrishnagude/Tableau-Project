# Tableau-Project
Synopsis of the Project:
In this project, I compared the number of people who use over-the-top (OTT) platforms to watch movies and television shows.

#Insights:
-> The majority of individuals are more inclined to watch movies than TV series.
-> The genre that viewers watch the most is documentaries, followed by stand-up comedy.
-> Movie attendance is growing more quickly each year than television viewing.
